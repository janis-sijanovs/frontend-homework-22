# Frontend Homework 22

I have finished my twenty-second homework.

This is even lazier than the last one.
I completely ignored styling.
Didn't care about DRY.
Left a bunch of prettier errors in.

At least the logic part of the homework works.

I still need to learn a bunch of VueJS niches.
And I am slowly falling apart because of some personal life issues. 
Will try to fix everything and get back on track.
So only spent around 2 very sleepy tired hours on the homework.
Even though I well know we had more time.
Just busy trying to put my life together.
